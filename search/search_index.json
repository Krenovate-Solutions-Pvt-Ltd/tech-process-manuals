A DNS server is a machine which makes this correspondence. Types of DNS Records \u00b6 Some of the type of DNS records used are discussed below: A Records \u00b6 A Records direct browser requests to an origin web server. CNAME Records \u00b6 CNAME Records direct browser requests to an origin web server, but \u2014 unlike an A or AAA record \u2014 do so via a hostname like www.agency.krenovate.com instead of an IP address. MX Records \u00b6 MX Records are necessary for delivery of email to a mail server. Any MX record Server name requires a corresponding A record that lists the IP address of the mail server. TXT Records \u00b6 TXT Records are commonly used for mail authentication. SPF Records \u00b6 An SPF record is a type of TXT record that lists all servers authorized to send email messages from a domain. DKIM Record \u00b6 DKIM records are a type of TXT record that associate email messages with domain names. NS Records \u00b6 NS Records contain information about your nameservers. Use these records to identify which nameservers you should use if you want to manage your domain with a different hosting service. Note The top 4 records are the most commonly used records. Read more about DNS Record types here Platforms \u00b6 At Krenovate, we use 3 platforms to manage the domains for client websites. All 3 are explained below: GoDaddy \u00b6 In this case, the domain is registered and hosted with GoDaddy. All the DNS settings will be managed through the GoDaddy account. Follow the below steps: Login to your GoDaddy account. Select your domain to access the domain settings page. Click -> Manage DNS If an A record already exists, you can edit it to the IP you want or Create a new one. To add \u201cwww\u201d subdomain use add a CNAME record which points to \u201c@\u201d. Edit/Change an A Record \u00b6 On the DNS Management page, select the edit dns icon next to the A record you need to edit. Edit the below details for your A record: Host : The host name the A record links to. Type @ to point directly to your domain name. Points to : The IP address you are setting as the destination for the host. TTL : How long the server should cache information. The default setting is 1 hour. Click -> Save to save changes. Note The above process can be followed to edit/add any kind of record. Refer the Link DigitalOcean \u00b6 In this case, if the Domain is registered with other registrar we can manage the DNS on DigitalOcean, hence, the DNS records would be managed through the DigitalOcean account. This is determined by where your nameservers are pointing. Add Domain \u00b6 Adding a domain you own to your DigitalOcean account lets you manage the domain\u2019s DNS records with the control panel and API. Below are the steps to follow: Login to your DigitalOcean Account. From the control panel, click -> Create menu -> Domains/DNS . Networking section - Enter domain name in Add a Domain field. Once you\u2019ve added a domain, click its name to view and modify its DNS records. Refer - How to Add Domain Manage DNS Records \u00b6 Now, you can add, modify, and delete DNS records for a domain. Create a New Record \u00b6 To create a record: Select the record type just below the heading Fill in the fields required for that record type Click -> Create record. Modify/Edit a Record \u00b6 To modify/update/delete an existing Record: Open the record's More menu Click -> Edit Record - to change/update the record values. Click -> Delete - to permanently delete the record. Refer - Manage DNS Records The supported record types sections have detailed instructions for each type of record. Nameservers \u00b6 This is an important step in order to be able to manage your domain through DigitalOcean. To connect a GoDaddy domain with the DigitalOcean droplet, we have to replace the GoDaddy nameservers with the DigitalOcean Nameservers. Follow the below steps: Login to your GoDaddy account. Go to -> Domain manager Click on the domain name you want to manage Scroll down to -> Manage Nameservers Click -> Change Enter the DigitalOcean Nameservers here. DigitalOcean name servers are by default: ns1.digitalocean.com ns2.digitalocean.com ns3.digitalocean.com Wait for few minutes for GoDaddy to refresh the DNS settings. The Manage DNS should look like this: Cloudflare \u00b6 At Cloudflare, DNS can be managed for a domain registered with some other registrar. For this to happen - a unique account for each client has to be setup. To do so, follow below steps in this guide: Create a Cloudflare Account \u00b6 Go to www.cloudflare.com Signup using an email id and password. Click -> Create Account Add a Domain to the account \u00b6 Login to your Cloudflare account. Click on Add Site from the top navigation bar. Enter your website\u2019s root domain and then click Add Site. For example, if your website is \" www.krenovate.com \", type \"krenovate.com\". Cloudflare, will then attempt to automatically identify your DNS records. This process takes approximately 60 seconds to complete. At this step, make sure that all the important records are being set properly. Some missing records may need to be added manually . Select a plan level - click confirm for the selected plan. Copy the 2 Cloudflare nameservers displayed and click Continue . To finish domain setup and activate your domain on Cloudflare, change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare , as in the below section. Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare \u00b6 To change your domain nameservers, you will need to use information from Cloudflare to update admin settings at your current registrar. Login to your registrar (GoDaddy) account and remove the existing nameservers. Replace with the Cloudflare nameservers (copied in step 7 in the above section). Click -> Save - wait for a confirmation mail within 24 hrs. Refer here for more information Managing DNS Records \u00b6 Add DNS Records \u00b6 If you need to add DNS records manually: Within a specific account and domain, go to DNS. Select -> Add record . Based on the record Type, you may have to fill out different fields. Refer link for complete instructions. Delete a DNS Record \u00b6 Within a specific account and domain, go to DNS. On a specific record, select Edit . Select -> Delete . A confirmation dialog appears. Select Delete again to confirm.","title":"DNS Management"},{"location":"DNS-Management/#dns-management","text":"","title":"DNS Management"},{"location":"DNS-Management/#introduction-dns-management","text":"DNS translates domain names to IP addresses and that's why it is often called the \"phonebook of the Internet.\" Domain Naming Service (DNS) establishes the correspondence between the domain name of your site (e.g : https://agency.krenovate.com/ ) and the IP address where it is hosted (e.g : 213.244.184.122) on the Internet.

Client Optimization \u00b6 WordPress frontend optimization constitutes the performance of the website when the website loads in the browser. We use GTMetrix to analyse and investigate our problem. Other tools used are: Google Page Speed Insight Pingdom Chrome LightHouse Basics of Website Optimization \u00b6 The main aim of Website Optimization is to get good scores in all the key metrics. A sample report is below: For every report you get GTMerix grade, consisting of 2 parts: Performance Score \u00b6 The Performance Score tells you how well your page performs from a user perspective. Your Performance Score is essentially your Lighthouse Performance Score, as captured by GTmetrix, with their custom audits, Analysis Options, browser and hardware specifications. Know more about the Performance score here . Performance Metrics \u00b6 The Performance score is made up of 6 key metrics: The 6 key metrics hold the following weightage: First Contentful Paint ( 15% ) - How quickly content like text or images are painted onto your page. Speed Index ( 15% ) - How quickly the contents of your page are visibly populated. Largest Contentful Paint ( 25% ) - How long it takes for the largest element of content (e.g. a hero image) to be painted on your page. Time to Interactive ( 15% ) - How long it takes for your page to become fully interactive. Total Blocking Time ( 25% ) - How much time is blocked by scripts during your page loading process. Cumulative Layout Shift ( 5% ) - How much your page's layout shifts as it loads. Structure Score \u00b6 The Structure Score tells you how well your page is built for optimal performance. Everything you need to know about the Structure Score Note: The sample test was done for Desktop from Chennai, India. These settings also matter. You can change the location to where your customers are to get more relevant report and change your device to Mobile in order to get your mobile score. Optimizing your Website \u00b6 Once your report is ready you can follow the below steps to increase the performance of your website. You can scroll down to Page Details to understand what is the request size and how is it distributed amongst assets. Structure Tab \u00b6 Visit the Structure tab. You will be able to see multiple impact type issues. Open each issue to learn what it says - there can be links to other articles which tells better about the issue. Figure out the issue after reading it. Solve it. Push it. Retest to see if it gets fixed or not. You should start from High Impact Issue and then go down to Lower once and try to fix as many as possible. Waterfall Tab \u00b6 Visit the Waterfall tab You can see exact resources being loaded. Select only CSS to check all CSS files. Remove the unnecessary files and retest. Repeat step 3 for JS, Fonts and Images. Keep a check that no unnecessary files are being loaded. Common Practices \u00b6 Some common practices to follow during development to make sure the website performance is well optimized: Use optimized images: Use add_image_size hook to predefine image sizes so that when someone uploads the image, it gets cropped and resized to the required size. Read on how to use add_image_size Eg: add_image_size ('soi-card', 561, 786, true); Optimize Font: When adding font in your theme make sure you load the font with display the font as swap - This solves the Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) problem. You can read about it here . CSS & JS: Keep your CSS and JS in modules so that when the production theme is built, only the concerned CSS and JS are loaded for a particular page. Server Size Optimization \u00b6 When you do a GTMetrix test for a particular website, you get an initial server response time which basically \u201cis the time it takes for the browser to receive the first byte in response to the browser request.\u201d This can greatly affect your website performance, as it is responsible for fetching the code from the server before the CSS and JS is compiled in the browser. There are multiple reasons for this to be slow. A score of more than 300ms is considered not good for a website. You can do the following to optimize the Server Response Time: Optimizing your application code Implementing server-side caching upgrading server hardware for more CPU or memory resources There are APM's (application performance management tools) which can be used to monitor and debug, to optimize performance. We use one such APM called - Newrelic . Installing Newrelic on a Server \u00b6 Step1 : Install the Newrelic application on a particular server. Follow the below steps to install: Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements , including appropriate system permissions . If you do not already have a New Relic account, create one . From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. Ubuntu or Debian: Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Newrelic Installation Guide The above process will install PHP Newrelic on your server. Step 2: Install WordPress specific functionalities for better data and reporting. If you install New Relic for WordPress websites , the PHP agent receives additional metrics. A WordPress page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to -> one.newrelic.com -> APM -> ( select a WordPress app ). Once the above is set and data starts to come in, you can start analysing the report and fixing them. Newrelic Application Decoded \u00b6 Below, we will learn how to use the Newrelic functionalities to optimize the server performance. For the purpose of example, we will use the Shades of India (SOI) account details. Login to your Newrelic account. This is the Dashboard that is visible Select the Shades of India Live application - it will take you to the explorer view In order to start analysing the requests -> change the view from Explorer to APM. Follow below steps: Click on explorer Select APM Select the application name -> Shades of India Live: You will reach the below screen: Transactions \u00b6 The best place to start your optimization is Transactions tab, see below: When you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will see -> Transaction Traces - these are the recent requests which are probably taking long durations. For example: you can see \u2018/product/fulva-kurta/\u2019 taking 1s of backend response time. You can click on the Transaction to know more about it. This propup has 3 tabs to analyse the request: Summary Trace Details Database Summary \u00b6 Once you have analysed the summary you can understand which are the most slow and time taking process for that particular request. This graph tells you in an overview: Trace Details \u00b6 This is the most important part of this task and it will give you the most important insights into your request. Click on expand all button to expand every request You will get a Waterfall graph - gives you an idea of time taken by every function in that particular request Now the bottom most blue-bar gives you a relative idea of the time utilized by that particular function and its children. You can scroll down and take a quick look at every bar to find the longest one. This is the view you will get: Once you spot the time consuming function, for example : \" getRecentlyViewedSingleProduct \" function seems to be taking 143ms . In this case: Optimize your code for that function Again visit this particular page to get a transaction function. You can now check the time of this function again to see if it got better scores now. This way you can basically identify the functions which are creating bottlenecks and then you can: Optimize the function Or, replace the function. The above activity has to be done until you reach a response time near to 300ms. Note Once you have fully optimized your application, it is recommended that you uninstall the Newrelic agent.
