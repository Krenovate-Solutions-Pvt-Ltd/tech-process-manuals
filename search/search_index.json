There are different ways to host a website on DigitalOcean depending on the requirements. Here we will discuss steps to manually control the infrastructure ourselves. This is done through creating Droplets. Droplets \u00b6 Droplets are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of virtualized hardware. Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure. Get more information on droplets here Steps to create a Droplet \u00b6 Below are the basic steps to follow to create a Droplet: From the Create menu in the top right of the control panel, click Droplets. Choose an image, which can be a Linux distribution, container distribution, one-click app, snapshot, or backup. Choose a plan and size for your Droplet, which determines its RAM, disk space, and vCPUs as well as its price. Learn more about how to choose the right Droplet plan. The Droplet create screen has a number of options after this, which you can customize now or after creation. To accept the defaults, scroll to the bottom and click Create. Otherwise: Optionally, add block storage. Choose a datacenter region. Select additional options, like IPv6 and monitoring. These options come at no additional cost, and are easier to enable now than after creation. Select a VPC network for the Droplet. Select additional options, like IPv6 and monitoring. These options come at no additional cost, and are easier to enable now than after creation. Choose an SSH key, if you\u2019ve added one, or create a root password for the Droplet. Enter a name and click Create. For a more descriptive process, follow the link Connect the Droplet \u00b6 Once the above steps have been followed and you have the Droplet's IP address, username and password, follow the instructions to connect to the Droplet with SSH.

It is a computer that serves information to other computers. These computers, called clients , can connect to a server through either a local area network or a wide area network, such as the internet. A server is a vital piece of your IT infrastructure. Any computer running the right software can be a server. What does a Server do? \u00b6 A server collects and sends information across a network. That can be a local network, like your business network, or a wider network across multiple locations. Types of Servers \u00b6 Some of the main Server types are explained below: Web Server \u00b6 The primary task of a web server is to store, process, and deliver websites to clients, like web browsers and search engine crawlers. File Server \u00b6 File servers care for the central storage of data accessible for a number of different clients via a network. Companies rely on this file management to provide multiple workgroups access to the same file. File servers protect against problems arising from various local file versions by enabling automatic versioning of files and a centralized backup of all corporate data. Mail Server \u00b6 A mail server consists of several software modules that work together to enable e-mails to be sent, received, forwarded, and retrieved. Database Server \u00b6 A database server is a computer program that gives other programs access to one or several database systems via a network. Software solutions like this include Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and DB2. Database servers support web servers by storing and delivering data. Game Server \u00b6 Game servers (software) are specialized for online-based multiplayer gaming. They manage data from the online game and enable a synchronized interaction with the virtual world. Proxy Server \u00b6 A proxy server serves as a communication interface in computer networks. Acting as an intermediary, the proxy server accepts requests from the network and forwards them on via its own IP address. Proxies are used to filter communication, control bandwidths, increase availability by load balancing, or to cache data. A proxy server also offers increased anonymity because the client\u2019s IP address is hidden behind the proxy. DNS Server \u00b6 DNS, or name servers, are responsible for name resolution on a network. This is central to the World Wide Web, because a DNS server will translate the human-friendly host name (like https://agency.krenovate.com/ ) into the corresponding IP address. Type of Servers fall under two categories: Offline servers are your laptop, USB, mobile phones and anything that shows you data without using the internet. Online servers are similar machines which store information and data and are only accessible through the internet. All online servers have an IP address, which is used to access the information on that server. Online servers are provided by hosting service providers. What is Hosting? \u00b6 Web hosting is an online service that enables you to publish your website on the Internet. In a nutshell, web hosting is the process of renting or buying space to house a website on the World Wide Web. Website content such as HTML, CSS, and images has to be housed on a server to be viewable online. Hosting is provided by the web hosting service providers. Web Hosting Service Providers \u00b6 These are companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers. For example, Godaddy and Digitalocean are hosting providers that offer a range of different types of online servers that you can use to store and run your websites and apps. In the further sections we will see how to create and setup servers on Digitalocean. How to create a server?

OpenLiteSpeed WordPress \u00b6 The OpenLiteSpeed WordPress One-Click app is based on a standard WordPress image, but includes several great performance enhancements, including LiteSpeed's popular LSCache optimization plugin. This Wordpress + OpenLiteSpeed + LSCache image tends to be more than 300 times faster than a regular WordPress image! OpenLiteSpeed WordPress One-Click automatically installs OpenLiteSpeed, LSCache, WordPress and any dependences. It also automates initial setup for components like Object Cache and PHP OPCache to reduce the time it takes to optimize a web server. Setup the Droplet - Quick Start \u00b6 Step 1 \u00b6 DigitalOcean used as Host Setup an OpenLiteSpeed Server on a $5 droplet server (use recommended size if told otherwise) Choose a Data center close to the visitor. (Bangalore in India) Save root password in Password Cred Sheet. Add a DNS record using IP just created. Step 2 \u00b6 From a terminal on your local computer, connect to the server as root. Login to the Droplet (Host) as below: ssh root@use_your_server_ip Note: Be sure to substitute the server\u2019s public IP address for use_your_server_ip.
