#   **Servers**

##  **What is a server?**

A server is a computer that connects other web users to your site from anywhere in the world. It is a computer that serves information to other computers. These computers, called **clients**, can connect to a server through either a local area network or a wide area network, such as the internet. A server is a vital piece of your IT infrastructure. Any computer running the right software can be a server. 

##  **What does a Server do?**

A server collects and sends information across a network. That can be a local network, like your business network, or a wider network across multiple locations.

## **Types of Servers**

Some of the main Server types are explained below:

### **Web Server**

The primary task of a web server is to store, process, and deliver websites to clients, like web browsers and search engine crawlers.

### **File Server**

File servers care for the central storage of data accessible for a number of different clients via a network. Companies rely on this file management to provide multiple workgroups access to the same file. File servers protect against problems arising from various local file versions by enabling automatic versioning of files and a centralized backup of all corporate data.

### **Mail Server**

A mail server consists of several software modules that work together to enable e-mails to be sent, received, forwarded, and retrieved.

### **Database Server**

A database server is a computer program that gives other programs access to one or several database systems via a network. Software solutions like this include Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and DB2. Database servers support web servers by storing and delivering data.  

### **Game Server**

Game servers (software) are specialized for online-based multiplayer gaming. They manage data from the online game and enable a synchronized interaction with the virtual world.

### **Proxy Server**

A proxy server serves as a communication interface in computer networks. Acting as an intermediary, the proxy server accepts requests from the network and forwards them on via its own IP address. Proxies are used to filter communication, control bandwidths, increase availability by load balancing, or to cache data. A proxy server also offers increased anonymity because the clientâ€™s IP address is hidden behind the proxy.

### **DNS Server**

DNS, or name servers, are responsible for name resolution on a network. This is central to the World Wide Web, because a DNS server will translate the human-friendly host name (like https://agency.krenovate.com/) into the corresponding IP address. 


Type of Servers fall under two categories:

**Offline servers** are your laptop, USB, mobile phones and anything that shows you data without using the internet.

**Online servers** are similar machines which store information and data and are only accessible through the internet. All online servers have an IP address, which is used to access the information on that server.
Online servers are provided by hosting service providers.


##  **What is Hosting?**

Web hosting is an online service that enables you to publish your website on the Internet. In a nutshell, web hosting is the process of renting or buying space to house a website on the World Wide Web. Website content such as HTML, CSS, and images has to be housed on a server to be viewable online. Hosting is provided by the web hosting service providers.

### **Web Hosting Service Providers**

These are companies which are in the business of creating and managing online servers. For example, Godaddy and Digitalocean are hosting providers that offer a range of different types of online servers that you can use to store and run your websites and apps.
